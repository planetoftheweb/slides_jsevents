# Hands-on React

> >

React is one of those core skills that every JavaScript Developer should understand, but over the last nine years, it has gotten more and more complicated. It now offers two different programming styles: Class or Function based components...which also use React Hooks.

This course is a hands on introduction to React that takes you through the most important parts of the library in way that makes sense quickly and where you'll code along with me

I'm super excited to be partnering with GitHub to bring you a version of this course that was created from scratch using CodeSpaces. I think it's going to be a lot of fun...so why wait. Let's get started!

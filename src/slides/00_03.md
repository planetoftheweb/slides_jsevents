The basic instructions for how to work with the slideshow are right here.

If you see a slideshow in a video, you can find that slideshow by going to the toolbar and choosing the proper video.

At the bottom of the screen, there is a toolbar, which you can show or hide by hitting the t key.

You can hit the M key to see the menu and then pick one of the videos for the course. If you want to watch the slides for the third video in the first chapter, then you'd pick this slideshow from the list.

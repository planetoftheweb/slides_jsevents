Event propagation allows you to have a single event capture all of the events in a parent element, sometimes we need to control how that happens.

# Event Propagation

- Feature of `addEventListener()`
- Targeting: [target](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/target), [currentTarget](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/target)
- [stopPropagation()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/stopPropagation)

Propagation is a feature of the addEventListener method. It's super convenient to be able to capture any events happening inside elements and then do something about them.

Remember that there are two targets that are triggered with events. The target and the current target. The target is the thing that caused the event and the current target changes as the event bubbles up the DOM.

That's why there's a special method called stoppropagation that allows us to stop the events from bubbling. Let's take a look at an example.

```html
  <main class="container" data-theme="light">
    <h1>JavaScript Events</h1>
    <article id="buttons">
      <button>Aneirin</button>
      <button id="charmaine">Charmaine</button>
      <button>Emmyloo</button>
    </article>
  </main>
```

document.querySelector("#buttons")
  .addEventListener("click", function (e) {
    this.style.backgroundColor = "darkgrey"
    if(e.target.tagName=="BUTTON") {
      e.target.style.backgroundColor = "green";
    }
  })

document.querySelector("#charmaine")
  .addEventListener("click", function (e) {
    e.stopPropagation();
    e.target.style.backgroundColor = "green";
  })

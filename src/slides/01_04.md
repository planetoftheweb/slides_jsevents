# useEffect Hook

- Side effects
- Outside scope
- Replaces lifecycles
- After render

The useEffect hook is the second most popular hook in React.

It allows you manage side effects. I'm not a fan of the term "effect" here, but it makes sense if you think of it like this.

A side effect is anythihg that deals with something outside of the scope of the current component. Like when you take a medicine and sometimes they can have side effects. Things the medicine didn't intend to do to you.

The way these used to be managed in old React was with different lifecycles methods. So you had a method called something like componentDidMount for when the component mounted and a method called componentDidUpdate for when the component updated.

Basically think it as letting you do something after rendering. React guarantees that the DOM has been updated.

But that's enough talk. Let's jump into codespaces and try out this hook.

Most of your projects will use the useEffect hook and the useStateHook together to help manage state. We'll take a look at how you can use them together in the next video.

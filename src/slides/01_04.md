# Preventing Defaults

Some events have default behaviors that trigger place when the events happen and every once in a while, we need to be able to cancel those behaviors.

# Preventing Defaults

- Link clicks
- Form submissions
- [preventDefault()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/preventDefault)
- [Finished Code](https://gist.github.com/planetoftheweb/ea85601e7d437e8f4f37d44c1149d40b)

So for example when we click on a link, the default behavior is to follow that link probably onto a website.

Or when the user tries to submit a form, the default behavior is to take the form data and pass it to a form processor. You might want to stop the data from being passed to the form processor, so you can do your own validation.

In order to control how an event reacts with default behavior, we use a method called prevent default. So, I'm going to show you how to do that.

We've been using CodePen for the majority of the code so far, but preventing defaults on a preview environment like this doesn't always work. So I created a link to a finished HTML page, so you can see this working in action.

```js
document.getElementById("links").addEventListener("click", function (e) {
  e.preventDefault();
});
```

# Customizing Styles

So far, we've been using inline styles for customizing the css. Let's talk about how you can customize your React projects with regular CSS.

## CSS Files

Although I've been using inline styles. Sometimes they don't make sense when using React. It makes more sense to use a separate CSS file when reusing styles or trying to affect entire tags.

For example, I wouldn't mind the headlines having a different color that's sort of a highlight.

We can do that with simple CSS.

```css
h1,
h2,
h3,
h4,
h5,
h6,
b,
summary,
a {
  color: #d81b60;
}

a {
  color: #d81b60;
  cursor: pointer;
}
```

The PicoCSS site also has a great place where you can control some of the [basic colors]((https://picocss.com/docs/customization.html)) for the site.

It smartly uses CSS variables that allow you to customize the colors of the site.

You can see all of the available variables at [this URL](https://github.com/picocss/pico/blob/master/css/themes/default.css)


Now, I have forced the page to publish in light mode. It looks a bit better on these demos.

I did that by adding an attribute to the HTML tag in our index.html file.

```
<html lang="en" data-theme="light">
```

If you take that off, it will respond to the system settings.
